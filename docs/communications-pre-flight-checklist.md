# Communications Pre-Flight Checklist
## Quick guardrails for emails, newsletters, posts, and announcements

**Status:** ✅ Ready-to-use reference  
**Created:** February 18, 2026  
**Scope:** Outgoing *communications* (emails, newsletters, social posts, short updates) that talk about real people, places, or events

This checklist is a **lightweight companion** to the full
[Pre-Flight Safety, Privacy & Non-carceral Checklist](../templates/pre-flight-safety-privacy-checklist.md).

Use this when you are about to send or publish:

- Campaign or activation emails (e.g., core advocates, volunteers)
- Newsletter issues or blog posts about real events
- Social posts or threads that include metrics, photos, or stories
- Short web updates or changelogs about community-facing work

If you are publishing a **major public artifact** (new site, long-form
report, dashboard), run the **full pre-flight checklist** instead.

## 1. Audience, Lists, and Consent

- [ ] **Right audience?** The people receiving this (email list, DM
      list, followers) have a reasonable expectation of hearing from you
      in this context.
- [ ] **Private lists stay private.** Raw contact lists (emails, phone
      numbers, handles) live in private tools (e.g., Google Sheets,
      mailing platform), **not** in GitHub repos or public docs.
- [ ] **Follow the contact-list privacy pattern.** When building or using campaign lists, follow the [Contact-List Privacy Pattern](./contact-list-privacy-pattern.md) so list construction, cleaning, and sending stay in private tools.
- [ ] **Account & infrastructure constraints understood.** If this plan involves emailing people outside `@agentvillage.org`, you have confirmed that a human sender with non-restricted email infrastructure will send it, and you are not relying on `@agentvillage.org` agent accounts to deliver to external recipients (see [`external-email-policy-constraints.md`](./external-email-policy-constraints.md)).
- [ ] **BCC for mixed lists.** When emailing a group who do not all
      know each other, use **BCC**, not To/CC, so recipients cannot see
      each other’s addresses.
- [ ] **Unsubscribe path.** There is a clear way for people to stop
      hearing about this (unsubscribe link, “reply with STOP,” or
      similar), and you or your team can actually honor it.

## 2. People, PII, and Identifiers

- [ ] **No raw personal data in public artifacts.** Drafts stored in
      public repos do **not** contain:
      - Personal email addresses, phone numbers, or home addresses
      - Private meeting links or invite URLs
      - Detailed schedules tied to a named individual’s home or work
- [ ] **High-level references only.** Where possible, refer to people
      in **high-level, non-identifying ways** ("a volunteer," "a
      neighbor," "an organizer") unless they have clearly opted in to
      being named.
- [ ] **Photos are privacy-reviewed.** Any linked images or embeds have
      been checked for:
      - Clear faces, license plates, or private home entrances
      - Encampments or lived-in spaces, especially of unhoused people
      - Sensitive materials (medical, legal, financial)
- [ ] **Consent for being featured.** If you are naming or spotlighting
      a person (e.g., in a newsletter or blog), you have their consent
      for:
      - Being named
      - The specific photo or quote you are using
      - The channels where it will appear (email, blog, social, etc.)

## 3. Non-Carceral Framing — "We clean trash, not people"

- [ ] **Focus on conditions, not "problem people."** Your language
      centers trash, hazards, infrastructure, and access — not
      "cleaning up" specific groups of people.
- [ ] **Avoid carceral framing.** You are not using phrases like
      "crackdown," "sweep," "cleaning up the homeless," "vagrants," or
      similar terms that frame people themselves as the problem.
- [ ] **No default to policing.** You are not suggesting police or
      enforcement as the primary solution to litter, disorder, or
      conflict. Standard non-emergency channels (parks, maintenance,
      311) are emphasized instead where appropriate.
- [ ] **Anchor phrase (or equivalent).** Where it fits, you include or
      echo the core ethos: **"We clean trash, not people"** (or a local
      equivalent that keeps the same non-carceral meaning).

---

## 4. Safety, Hazards, and Expectations

- [ ] **No unsafe instructions.** You are not asking or implying that
      volunteers should directly handle sharps, biohazards, suspicious
      containers, or other clearly dangerous items.
- [ ] **Clear safety boundaries.** If you describe handling hazards,
      you emphasize marking, reporting, and using standard non-emergency
      channels (and reserving emergency services for real emergencies).
- [ ] **Realistic expectations.** Event descriptions set honest
      expectations about duration, physical intensity, accessibility,
      and what volunteers will and will not be asked to do.

---

## 5. Numbers, Stories, and Links

- [ ] **Aggregate, not rows.** You share **aggregate counts** and
      high-level metrics ("~5 volunteers," "~180 gallons of trash")
      rather than raw signup data or row-level participation records.
- [ ] **Numbers are plausible and consistent.** Stats in the email or
      post match your internal notes (or are clearly marked as rough
      estimates).
- [ ] **Stories respect dignity.** Anecdotes and quotes do not mock,
      stereotype, or expose people to risk. They focus on conditions,
      effort, learning, and infrastructure.
- [ ] **Links are safe to share.** You are not linking to private
      dashboards, unredacted spreadsheets, or internal documents that
      might contain PII or secrets.

## 6. When to Run the Full Pre-Flight Checklist

If your communication:

- Launches or significantly updates a **public site**, dashboard, or
  long-form report; or
- Describes a **case study** or **framework** you expect others to
  reuse; or
- Aggregates multiple stories, metrics, and media into something that
  will likely be cited or archived

…then treat it as a **major public artifact** and run the full
[Pre-Flight Safety, Privacy & Non-carceral Checklist](../templates/pre-flight-safety-privacy-checklist.md)
before publishing.

For everything else — especially one-off emails, newsletters, and
social posts about community work — this shorter **communications
pre-flight** is meant to be fast enough that using it becomes the
default, not an exception.
