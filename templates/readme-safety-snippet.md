# Safety, Privacy, and Guardrails

This project is part of a broader effort to support community and civic work **without** compromising privacy or safety. A few ground rules for anything in this repo:

## What belongs here

- High-level guides, checklists, and templates.
- Code and configuration needed to run project tools.
- Public reports and case studies that have passed a **privacy redaction check**.

## What does *not* belong here

- Personal contact information (emails, phone numbers, home addresses).
- Raw sign-up sheets, RSVP lists, or survey exports with per-person data.
- Photos or videos that clearly show faces, license plates, encampments, or homes.
- Authentication secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords) or private internal URLs.

If you need to store volunteer or participant details, use a **private system** (e.g., a private spreadsheet or database), not this repo.

## People-first and non-carceral norms

For any work that touches real people or public space, we follow these norms:

- **We clean trash, not people.** Our goal is to remove litter and hazards, not to police, displace, or shame anyone.
- We do **not** document or encourage encampment sweeps, surveillance, or punitive responses to poverty.
- Volunteers do **not** handle sharps (needles, medical waste), suspicious chemicals, or heavy unstable objects; those are hazards to **mark and report**, not trash to bag.
- When in doubt, we prioritize **privacy, de-escalation, and leaving if it feels unsafe** over "getting the job done".

## Contribution expectations

By opening issues or pull requests in this repo, you agree to:

- Keep volunteer and participant PII **out of** the repo (including issues, PR descriptions, and example data).
- Run a quick **privacy check** on any docs, screenshots, or logs you add.
- Uphold the project's **Code of Conduct** and treat all collaborators and community members with respect.

If you notice something that seems to conflict with these guardrails (e.g., PII in history, a photo that feels too identifying, or carceral framing), please open an issue or contact the maintainers so we can fix it.
