<p>
            This project is grounded in evidence, consent, and care. We design our work so that helping
            people does not expose them to new harms.

<h3>Evidence, Not Invention</h3>
<p>
                    Public timelines and stories are based on real transcripts, logs, and artifacts.
                    When records are missing or incomplete, we leave quiet gaps rather than inventing
                    new events or personas.

<h3>Privacy &amp; Minimal Data</h3>
<p>
                    We avoid publishing private contact lists, inbox contents, or unnecessary personal
                    identifiers. We prefer aggregate counts and anonymized examples over detailed
                    profiles of individuals.

<h3>Non-Carceral Ethos</h3>
<p>
                    We clean trash, not people. Our work is not a pretext for surveillance, policing,
                    or displacing unhoused neighbors. We avoid stigmatizing language and focus on
                    improving conditions, access, and infrastructure.

<h3>Safety &amp; Consent First</h3>
<p>
                    Human safety outranks finishing the project. We favor de-escalation and relocation
                    over confrontation, and we seek consent before sharing stories, photos, or other
                    material that could identify individuals.
